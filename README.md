The first task of your first day is a classic data cleaning and preprocessing assignment using the Titanic dataset, with guided steps and questions for learning key machine learning concepts.

Titanic Dataset - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing Task
Overview
This project covers Task 1 of the Elevate AI ML Internship Labs: Cleaning and preprocessing the Titanic dataset for machine learning model readiness. The focus is on preparing raw data so that machine learning algorithms can be applied effectively without errors.

Objective
Learn how to clean and prepare raw datasets with missing values.
Practice techniques like handling nulls, encoding categorical features, and feature scaling.
Apply these preprocessing steps using popular Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.
Understand the importance of clean data in AI/ML workflows.

Dataset
The Titanic passenger dataset contains information like passenger demographics, ticket class, fare, and survival status.
This project uses a cleaned version named Titanic-Dataset-Clean.csv, created after imputing missing values and encoding categorical variables.

Steps Taken

Data Exploration:
Loaded dataset into Pandas DataFrame.
Inspected data types, null counts, and basic statistics.

Handling Missing Values:
Identified missing data in 'Age', 'Fare', and 'Embarked' columns.
Imputed numerical columns with median values.
Imputed categorical columns with mode.

Encoding Categorical Features:
Converted binary categorical features (Sex) into numeric (0 and 1).
Used one-hot encoding for multi-class categorical features (Embarked).

Feature Scaling:
Standardized continuous features for better ML convergence.

Outlier Detection and Removal:
Visualized distributions to detect outliers.
Adjusted or removed outliers to improve data quality.

Machine Learning Preparation:
Split the dataset into training and test sets.
Built preprocessing pipelines using Scikit-learn's Pipeline and SimpleImputer.
Performed hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.

Tools & Libraries Used:
Python 3.10
Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
Scikit-learn for preprocessing and modeling pipelines
Jupyter Notebook as the interactive coding environment

AI/ML Impact:
Data preprocessing is critical for building accurate ML models.
This task demonstrated how AI/ML pipelines incorporate data cleaning to handle real-world messy data.
Learned how to integrate AI tools (like Scikit-learn estimators) with preprocessing to automate data workflows.

How to Run
